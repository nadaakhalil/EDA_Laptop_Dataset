# Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description:

This project is part of my Data Analytics coursework.  
It focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a small Laptop dataset.

---

## Files Included:

- **Laptops.csv** → The dataset I used for analysis.  
- **Task2_EDA.ipynb** → The Python notebook file containing my EDA code and outputs.

---

## Steps I Performed:

1. **Loaded the dataset using Pandas library.**
2. **Displayed the first few rows** to check if the data loaded correctly.
3. **Checked data structure and types** using `.info()`.
4. **Generated basic statistics** (like mean, min, max, standard deviation) using `.describe()`.
5. **Checked for missing values** using `.isnull().sum()`.

---

## Summary of My Findings:

- The dataset contains **8 laptop products** and **3 columns**: Product Name, Price, and Ratings.
- There are **no missing values** in the dataset.
- The **average laptop price** is **800**.
- **Laptop prices range from 600 to 1000**.
- **Ratings range from 4.4 to 4.7**, which shows that all laptops have relatively good ratings.
- The data types are correct:  
   → Product Name = Text  
   → Price = Integer  
   → Ratings = Decimal (Float)

---

## What EDA Requirements I Covered:

- Explored the **data structure and types**  
- Identified **summary statistics and patterns**  
- Checked for **missing values or data issues**  
- Answered important questions about **price range**, **average ratings**, and **data completeness**

---

## Tools Used:

- **Google Colab**  
- **Python (Pandas library)**  
- **CSV file format**
